## Bandwidth Monitoring 

A demo application written in Go to monitor bandwidth transferred across all the network interfaces on an operating system.

- The monitoring part is implemented using [gopsutil](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil).
- And I used [color](github.com/fatih/color) for colorized logs.
- Tested on Windows.
